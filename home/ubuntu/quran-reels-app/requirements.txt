# Add other backend dependencies here as the project develops, e.g.:
# pydub # for audio manipulation if needed outside whisper
# Pillow # for image manipulation if needed for pinterest integration

# Dependencies for the cloned repositories (whisper and moviepy)
# will be inside their respective folders if they have their own requirements.txt
# or need to be added here if they are to be installed in the main backend environment.
# For now, assuming they are self-contained or their requirements will be handled separately.
